# Plan #

## Profiler ##

Minimum plan:
- implement profiler class that can be used as a profiler for .NET based applications
- gather informations about stack traces dduring the excution of the program
- implement basic flame-graph to visualize the execution timelime

## Debugging ##

Issues found during development:

- Loading profiler failed.  There was an unhandled exception while trying to instantiate the profiler COM object.  Please ensure the CLSID is associated with a valid profiler designed to work with this version of the runtime.  Profiler CLSID: '{DC27BF80-3A36-40D4-9278-6415508C4ED6}'.

## Debugger ##

Minimum plan:
- starting a binary
- attaching
- setting a breakpoint
